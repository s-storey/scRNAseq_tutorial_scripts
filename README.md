# scRNAseq Tutorial Scripts

This repository contains R scripts and supporting files to help trainees learn scRNAseq data processing, visualization and analysis.

Each script is designed to be a separate module. For new users, the intended order is:

1. Processing 
2. Annotation, differential expression and subsetting
3. Visualization
4. Public accessing
5. Integration. 

I will periodically be adding tutorial scripts with more advanced techniques and methods, stay tuned!
